# CLRM Lineage

Append-only.

## 2026-09-25 — CLRM Program Opened

- Program: **Continual Loss Response Modeling (CLRM)**.
- Branch: `research/continual-loss-response`.
- Exact parent: MSA formal convergence commit
  `64138ab9cb09dcb56a387d3b1f500063eff8302d`.
- Parent replicated finding:
  `ACCURACY_COARSE_LOSS_INFORMATIVE`.
- Program identity: **new program / not CPRM-2**.
- Primary response vector:
  `[L_current_end, L_prior_mean_end]` for each A/B/C policy.
- Direct channels: **6**.
- A-relative contrasts: B-A and C-A, each with two loss components.
- Terminal accuracy role: sentinel/diagnostic only.
- Primary population: all prospectively eligible T1→T2, T2→T3, T3→T4
  matched boundaries.
- Fresh-data roles: support-only → discovery train/sealed validation →
  independent replication.
- Spent exclusions: KCL, ACO-1, CPRM-1, MSA-1, MSA-3.
- Predictor fitting: **NOT AUTHORIZED**.
- Fresh scientific execution: **NOT AUTHORIZED**.
- Controller/KCL-7: **CLOSED**.
- Current milestone: **CLRM-0 Specification Foundation**.

## 2026-09-25 — CLRM-0 QA Attempt 1 Technical Infrastructure Failure

- Workflow: `36056186547`.
- Failure point: static specification tests before validator execution.
- Root cause: GitHub runner Python environment did not have `pytest` installed.
- Classification: **TECHNICAL_QA_INFRASTRUCTURE_FAILURE / ZERO-SCIENCE**.
- Scientific target changed: **NO**.
- Baseline/gate/partition contracts changed: **NO**.
- Fresh seed execution: **NO**.
- Scientific outcome generated: **NO**.
- Predictor fitting: **NO**.
- Controller execution: **NO**.
- QA recovery also narrows the CPRM anti-reuse assertion to the actual primary
  target-definition block, because the document intentionally names historical
  CPRM variables in a prohibition section.
