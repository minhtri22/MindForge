## 2026-09-25 — CLRM Program Opened

- Program: **Continual Loss Response Modeling (CLRM)**.
- Branch: `research/continual-loss-response`.
- Exact parent: MSA formal convergence commit
  `64138ab9cb09dcb56a387d3b1f500063eff8302d`.
- Parent replicated finding:
  `ACCURACY_COARSE_LOSS_INFORMATIVE`.
- Program identity: **new program / not CPRM-2**.
- Primary response vector:
  `[L_current_end, L_prior_mean_end]` for each A/B/C policy.
- Direct channels: **6**.
- A-relative contrasts: B-A and C-A, each with two loss components.
- Terminal accuracy role: sentinel/diagnostic only.
- Primary population: all prospectively eligible T1→T2, T2→T3, T3→T4
  matched boundaries.
- Fresh-data roles: support-only → discovery train/sealed validation →
  independent replication.
- Spent exclusions: KCL, ACO-1, CPRM-1, MSA-1, MSA-3.
- Predictor fitting: **NOT AUTHORIZED**.
- Fresh scientific execution: **NOT AUTHORIZED**.
- Controller/KCL-7: **CLOSED**.
