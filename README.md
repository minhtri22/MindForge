# MindForge

> Build small. Prove first. Scale only what survives contact with reality.

MindForge is a compact, local-first LLM research system built to make model training, evaluation and experimentation practical on consumer hardware. Its architecture distinguishes the **Model** from the **Kernel**: the Model is the learned neural component, while the Kernel is the minimal generic runtime/core that operates it. Optional feature capabilities live outside the kernel as plugins/extensions, and hosts/products compose the pieces they need.

It is inspired by the clarity of **nanochat** and the breadth of **MiniMind**, while deliberately being neither a feature collection nor a purely educational Transformer.

The project grows through **thin, measurable, usable vertical slices**. Every uncertain assumption is tested before dependent architecture is added.

## Architecture model

```text
Host / Product
    |
    +-- MindForge Kernel
    |      |
    |      +-- MindForge Model
    |
    +-- optional Plugins / Extensions
```

Architecture responsibilities:

```text
The Model owns learned representations/capabilities.
The Kernel owns only proven universal primitives.
Plugins own feature-specific mechanisms and semantics.
Hosts own composition.
```

A new capability does not enter the kernel merely because it is useful. Domain/product/optional capabilities belong outside the kernel by default; host/platform-specific capabilities belong in hosts/adapters; learned/generalizable capabilities should first be treated as model research questions. A runtime capability becomes a kernel candidate only after separate evidence shows it is genuinely universal and cannot be cleanly externalized.

The authoritative architecture decision is [docs/research/mindforge-architecture-invariants.md](docs/research/mindforge-architecture-invariants.md).

## Principles

1. **Thin slices over feature breadth** — build only what a concrete experiment needs.
2. **Prove before architecture** — uncertain assumptions belong in Phase 0.
3. **End-to-end before sophisticated** — raw text → tokenizer → train → checkpoint → eval → generation.
4. **Claims require baselines** — every treatment answers “better than what?”.
5. **Local-first, cloud-optional** — constrained hardware is a first-class target; cloud is for scale, not comprehension.
6. **Evidence gates development** — PASS advances; REVISE changes the experiment; STOP removes unsupported scope.

## Borrowed deliberately

From nanochat: small understandable code, cohesive end-to-end training, explicit evaluation, compute awareness, reproducibility, strong baselines, minimal abstraction.

From MiniMind: the option to explore SFT, PEFT, preference/RL methods, distillation, memory, continual learning, routing/MoE, and agents **only when justified by a measurable question**.

## Non-goals

MindForge is not a Hugging Face replacement, production serving platform, benchmark leaderboard, paper-implementation catalog, or miniature ChatGPT clone.

## First vertical slice

The first usable model/runtime slice must:

1. prepare a small text dataset;
2. train or load a tokenizer;
3. construct a tiny Transformer;
4. train it;
5. save and resume checkpoints;
6. measure validation loss;
7. generate text;
8. record experiment metadata.

## Research discipline

Each experiment records at minimum: experiment id, git commit, seed, model config, parameter count, dataset/token count, context length, batch/effective batch, optimizer/LR/steps, device/dtype, peak memory, wall-clock time, train/validation loss, and evaluation results.

Comparisons hold dataset, tokenizer, seeds, compute budget, and evaluation set constant whenever practical.

## Evidence states

- **PASS** — evidence supports continuing.
- **REVISE** — promising but the implementation or experiment must change.
- **STOP** — the assumption failed; dependent architecture is not built.

A STOP result is useful evidence.

## Hardware policy

Core model code avoids backend-specific assumptions. Device selection is explicit. Target-machine capability is measured, never inferred from specifications.

Phase 0 validated **Intel XPU + BF16** as the primary local training backend on the target Intel Arc 140V machine. CPU remains useful for preprocessing, tests, diagnostics and FP32 fallback. Other backends remain conditional on direct evidence.

## Model policy

The initial model stays deliberately boring: embedding, pre-norm attention/MLP residual blocks, final norm, LM head. Novel research starts around a strong boring baseline.

## Validated foundation

Phase 0 established a reproducible local foundation: MindForge byte-level BPE with a 16,384-token vocabulary, deterministic Vietnamese/English Wikimedia data, a 1M-token development pool, a ~10.34M-parameter Baseline-0, checkpoint/resume, independent evaluation, and machine-readable experiment provenance. See [docs/phases/phase-0.md](docs/phases/phase-0.md).

Phase 1 turns that evidence into a working compact end-to-end model/runtime slice under `mindforge/`. The default 10,339,200-parameter model is validated on Intel Arc 140V with XPU/BF16, including training, checkpoint/resume, independent evaluation and generation. See [docs/phases/phase-1.md](docs/phases/phase-1.md).

Phase 2 adds a reproducible experiment system: manifests, baseline/treatment relationships, multi-seed execution, automatic aggregation, paired comparison, resource comparison, and regression checks — all from machine-readable records without external dependencies. See [docs/phases/phase-2.md](docs/phases/phase-2.md).

Minimal command surface:

```text
python -m mindforge.tokenizer train --input ... --output ...
python -m mindforge.data prepare --tokenizer ... --train-text ... --validation-text ... --output-dir ...
python -m mindforge.train --config ...
python -m mindforge.evaluate --checkpoint ... --tokenizer ... --tokens ...
python -m mindforge.generate --checkpoint ... --tokenizer ... --prompt ...
python -m mindforge.experiment validate <manifest>
python -m mindforge.experiment run <manifest>
python -m mindforge.experiment summarize <manifest>
python -m mindforge.experiment check <manifest>
```

The currently validated core research path remains intentionally narrow:

```text
dataset
→ tokenizer
→ Transformer Model
→ training
→ checkpoint
→ evaluation
→ generation
```

Future optional capabilities must earn their placement through evidence. They do not become kernel architecture merely because they are useful.

## Roadmap

MindForge uses an evidence-driven capability roadmap:

```text
Question → smallest experiment → evidence → decision → next capability
```

See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

Research scope is indexed in [docs/research/README.md](docs/research/README.md).

## Success criterion

MindForge succeeds when a research question can be expressed as:

```text
baseline + one meaningful change + controlled experiment + measurement
```

without weeks of framework work.
